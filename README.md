# MyKitchen

A simple kitchen helper app built with Vite + React + Tailwind. It tracks ingredient stock, suggests recipes, and builds a grocery list.

## Mobile behavior
- Main sections (Malzeme Stoğu, Önerilen Tarifler, Alışveriş Listesi) are collapsible and start closed on first load.
- Tap a section header to reveal its items. Your open/closed choices are remembered on this device.

## Development
- Install deps and start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Build production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```
